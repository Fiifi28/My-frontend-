<h2>    About Professor Allotey    </h2>
<p>    Two years ago, I recorded a video on my YouTube channel 
    where I was talking about the same topic of this chapter.
     ‘NO’ is not a negative answer. I must say that the video didn’t do 
     great in terms of visualisations, but are you even surprised? People might
      have seen the title, and before skipping the video, they might have thought, 
      ‘Who is this crazy guy that thinks no is not a negative answer?’.             </p>
